# Interview Scheduler

## Project Description
- Interview Scheduler is a SPA (Single Page Application) built using React that allows users to book and cancel interviews. 
- Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.
- The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format.
- Jest tests are used through the development of the project.
